This atlas provides a series of detailed maps of commercial fishing activity around Ireland with the aim of providing insights into fishing activities and fisheries resources. The atlas contains maps of: <br>Fishing effort by vessels of all nationalities by gear type inside the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ); <br>Fishing effort by Irish vessels gear type in all areas where it takes place for each; <br>Landings taken by Irish vessels for the main commercially exploited species. <p>The atlas is the fourth of its kind and is based on data from fishing vessels of =12m in length over the period 2018-2022. <p>The vessel monitoring and logbook data that form the basis of the maps were collected under Council Regulation (EC) No. 1224/2009 and were aggregated and processed by the Marine Institute.<p>Fishing is one of the most significant ocean uses in the waters around Ireland. However, the ocean is a shared resource and detailed spatial information on fishing activity is particularly relevant in the context of Ireland’s commitments to offshore wind energy and marine protected areas. The fisheries in Irish waters are highly diverse. A large part of this heterogeneity in the fisheries can be explained by spatial patterns in the availability of the target species and in this Atlas we aim to give insights into these fisheries by providing maps of fishing activities and landings of the most important fish and shellfish species.<p>",

Ireland’s coastline, inshore and offshore waters contain some of the largest and most valuable sea fisheries resources in Europe. <p>The NMPF supports management of sea-fisheries resources consistent with relevant environmental sustainability considerations and the development of the sector’s economic and social contribution to rural and coastal communities. The NMPF’s objectives in this sector include continuing to develop a sustainable seafood sector focused on competitiveness and innovation, with growth driven by a skilled workforce delivering value added products in line with market demands; promotion of a sustainable, profitable and self-reliant industry; sustaining primary food producers contributing to food security at a national and European level.  The evaluation of potential impacts on any commercial sea fishing activities needs to be given full consideration. Engagement with the fishing industry and other relevant stakeholders should occur as early as possible in planning or proposal-related processes to afford a chance for proper consideration of the industry’s views.",
