    <h1>About the Marine Atlas</h2>

      <p>The <strong>Atlas</strong> is a website for map-based access to spatial reference data from Irish government agencies.
      It is an initiative of the Marine Institute.</p>

      <!-- 4:3 aspect ratio -->
      <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-4by3">
        <!--<iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gsEAq0x0xh4?rel=0"></iframe> -->
		<iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/a6bWgfkU5PI?rel=0"></iframe>
      </div>

      <p>The <strong>Atlas</strong> is a fully open architecture. When you access data through it, you are typically
      accessing the data directly from the government department or agency which is the custodian of that data.</p>

      <p>The <strong>Atlas</strong>...</p>
      <ul>
         <li>provides easy access to authoritative and other spatial data to government, business and the public</li>
         <li>facilitates the opening of data by national and local government bodies</li>
         <li>provides an open framework of geospatial data services that supports commercial and community innovation</li>
      </ul>

      <p>To see what data is available on the Atlas, refer to the Data Catalogue in the
      <a href="https://atlas.marine.ie">Atlas</a> itself. Click the <b>Data Catalogue</b> tab and expand the Data Set group names.</p>

      <h2>How to use the Atlas</h2>

      <p>Just go to <a href="https://atlas.marine.ie/">https://atlas.marine.ie/</a>. Most operations are obvious,
      but you can click the <a href="help/help.html">Help and FAQs</a> button near the top of this page for specific instructions.</p>

      <p>For further information email <a href="mailto:datarequests@marine.ie">datarequests@marine.ie</a>.
      Feel free to send us feedback and bug reports.</p>

      <h2>Contributing Data to Atlas</h2>

      <p>Spatial data sets which are placed on <a href="https://data.marine.ie/" target="_blank">data.marine.ie</a> using supported data formats and protocols (such as WMS) will
      automatically be included in the Atlas. See the <a href="help/help.html">How To...</a> page for more information.</p>

      <p>Irish government agencies that wish to find out more information about contributing data sets to the Atlas
      should email <a href="mailto:datarequests@marine.ie">datarequests@marine.ie</a> with their questions.
      Typically, the Atlas does not store the data itself, but refers to the data servers of the data contributors,
      directly taking that data and presenting it overlaid over a map. Therefore, agencies providing data directly must have the data
      available via an online server using a standard protocol.</p>

      <h2>Atlas Software</h2>

      <p>The Atlas is Open Source software available as a
      <a href="https://github.com/NICTA/Atlas" target="_blank">Github project</a>. The core platform, <a href="https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs" target="_blank">TerriaJS</a>, was initially
      developed by Data61, but has subsequently been used for other projects. It has been made available
      to assist with the development of other spatial data viewing applications.</p>

      <p>The Atlas core software is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License"). You may not use the source code files
      except in compliance with the License. You may obtain a copy of the License at

      <h2>Additional Open Source Software Used</h2>

      <p>In developing the Atlas, Data61 has used open source software and contributed back to it. The Atlas leverages these
      excellent open source libraries:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs" target="_blank">TerriaJS</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://cesiumjs.org/" target="_blank">Cesium</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank">Leaflet</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>The <a href="https://github.com/IrishMarineInstitute/TerriaMap/blob/main/LICENSE.md">complete list</a> is available with the <a href="https://github.com/IrishMarineInstitute/TerriaMap">Atlas source code</a></p>
